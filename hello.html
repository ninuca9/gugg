    <h1>HELLO GUGA</h1>
    <h2>i love u so much</h2>
    <p>This is a little poem about how much i love u</p>
    <p> hope you enjoy it</p>
    <p>In the city of Giggleville, there lived a guy named Guga,
        A regular bloke, but with a secret, my, oh my, what a saga!
        By day, he'd crunch numbers, a mild-mannered chap,
        But by night, he'd don a cape, transforming into Guga-Bat!</p>
    <p>With a briefcase in hand and glasses on his nose,
        Guga fooled everyone, even his boss, who knows?
        He'd sneak into his office, muttering, "Holy spreadsheets, Batman!"
        Juggling ledgers by day, fighting crime in a slick, dark plan.</p>
    <p>His Batcave? Just a tiny cubicle, oh so neat,
        Where he'd switch from spreadsheets to superhero feats.
        Guga, the accountant by day, a hero by night,
        Saving Giggleville with laughter and justice, oh what a delight!</p>
        <p> p.s chatgpt is really good at writing poems</p>
